/*
Your READ ME notes to the Grader
Describe your enhancements to the program, map, etc. here.  You may include a link to a
YouTube video of a maximum of 2 minutes demonstrating your program.

0) Overview of your changes or a YouTube video link (max 2 minutes)
I have changed the elements in the new Configuration file, and add tests for the four methods.


1) Configuration Example: Contents of your own configuration (.advcfg) file
The game is about escaping the maze. The player will encounter the cavity, map, key, vampire in the maze adventure.
For example, if the player encounters the cavity, the player will lose, and the game is over.
             if the player encounters the vampire, he/she is eaten by the vampire, the game is over.
             if the player finds the key, the player will win, because he/she finds the key to unlock the door,
             the game is over and player wins.
             if the player finds the map, there is route appears on the map, which means map will guide the player
             somewhere, and random move.


2) Configuration Description: Describe unique elements in your configuration file
The game is about escaping the maze. The player will encounter the cavity, map, key, vampire in the maze adventure.
For example, if the player encounters the cavity, the player will lose, and the game is over.
             if the player encounters the vampire, he/she is eaten by the vampire, the game is over.
             if the player finds the key, the player will win, because he/she finds the key to unlock the door,
             the game is over and player wins.
             if the player finds the map, there is route appears on the map, which means map will guide the player
             somewhere, and random move.



3) writeMap Output: Example output of the writeMap method for your configuration file.

4) Choose at least 1 of the following ways you extended the game and describe them:
  a) Tools: added your own tools/weapons and use of them in the game
  b) Audio: playing of audio files when sensing the neighbors, rather than simply text
  c) Test Cases: adding test cases to TestAdventure that thoroughly test the methods you wrote.
  I add test cases for 4 methods
  d) Your Own: describe any other changes or additions we should consider for credit.
